### Techniques Used
1. **Input Validation:** The program checks that the user enters a valid array size (greater than 1), ensuring meaningful calculations.
2. **Sequential Summation:** It uses a single loop to calculate the sum of the array elements, which simplifies the process of averaging.
3. **Type Casting:** The program casts the sum and length to `double` to ensure that the division yields a decimal result, preventing integer division.
4. **Method Encapsulation:** The calculation of the average is encapsulated in a separate method (`average`), promoting code reuse and modular design.

### Strengths
1. **Simplicity and Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners.
2. **Efficient Calculation:** The average is calculated in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, ensuring efficiency.
3. **User-Friendly Interaction:** The program provides clear prompts for user input, enhancing the user experience.
4. **Robustness:** The validation for array size ensures that the program doesn't run into issues with small or invalid arrays, making it more robust.

Code: 

import java.util.*;

public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        //Initialization
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of digits in the array");
        int size = sc.nextInt();

        //Check to see if user entered valid array size
        while(size < 2){
            System.out.println("Not a valid input. Please enter more than 1 ");
            size = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] array = new int[size];

        //Array input
        System.out.println("Enter the array elements: ");
        for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
            array[i] = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        //Method call and output
        System.out.println("The average of the array is : " + average(array));
        
    }

    //Method to find average of the array
    static double average(int[] array){
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < array.length ; i++) 
            sum += array[i];
        return (double)sum / array.length;
    }
    
}
